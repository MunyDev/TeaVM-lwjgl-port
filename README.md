TeaVM-LWJGL-Port<br />
This is a port of LWJGL2 that attempts to simulate the library.
JAVAU files are unfinished java files.
OpenGL 3.0 to OpenGL 3.3 are untested. Use at your own risk.
Some functions may have no implementations due to them not being supported or that we are working on them.
All OpenGL Versions from OpenGL 1.1 to OpenGL 3.3 are finished.
Checkout the branch minimal-mc for the upcoming Minecraft port.
